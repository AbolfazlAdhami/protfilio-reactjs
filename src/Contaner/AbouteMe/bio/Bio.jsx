        Hi My name Abolfazl, I hope you are well A year ago, I decided to change my major and enter the field of programming and software engineering. I started styding on the basic topics of
        programming and , and then I started to learn about front-end and technology from October this year. I needed an internship for my junior year, but because of the same semester and the overlap
        of class times, I tried to find better courses and use the skills and training I learned to make mini-projects and create challenges for myself that make up for the lack of experience. tick
        Mostly, in this time and period, I am looking for a team and teammates who have the opportunity to make mistakes and learn, and to be able to be a useful and productive member of the group.
